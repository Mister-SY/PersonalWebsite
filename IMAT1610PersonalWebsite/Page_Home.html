    <h2>Let me tell you about myself</h2>
    <p>I am currently studying Computing. The reason I chose this course is because I've studied ICT courses in the past. I did good on those courses and I learned a lot about hardware, software and other information. So I chose this course to learn new skills and gain more knowledge about computers, devices, networks, programming etc. </p>
